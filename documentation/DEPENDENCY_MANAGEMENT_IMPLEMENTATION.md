#### `requirements-core.txt` - NEW: Minimal Core Dependencies
- Created new file with only essential dependencies (~20 packages)
- Removed heavy optional dependencies (scientific computing, visualization)
- Focused on core web framework, database, networking, and GPS functionality
- Provides lightweight installation option for production deployments

#### `requirements.txt` - Updated Full Dependencies
- Added clear section headers and comments
- Improved version pinning strategy with ranges

- Enhanced documentation about installation alternatives

### 2. Project Configuration

#### `pyproject.toml` - Enhanced Optional Dependencies
- Completely restructured `[project.optional-dependencies]` section
- Created logical groupings:
  - `performance`: orjson, ujson for speed optimizations
  - `analysis`: numpy, scipy, pandas, scikit-learn for data science
  - `visualization`: matplotlib, plotly, folium for charts/maps
  - `hardware`: mpu6050, pyrtlsdr, bleak for Raspberry Pi sensors
  - `integrations`: boto3, mqtt, rpy2 for external services
  - `development`: pytest, linting, security tools
  - `all`: Meta-package including all optional features

#### `Makefile` - Added Dependency Management Targets
- `deps-audit`: Run comprehensive dependency audit
- `deps-update`: Check for outdated packages
- `deps-security`: Run security vulnerability scans
- `deps-install-core`: Install minimal core dependencies
- `deps-install-full`: Install all dependencies
- `deps-install-dev`: Install development dependencies
- `deps-cleanup`: Clean up unused dependencies
- `deps-freeze`: Generate dependency freeze file

### 3. Automation and CI/CD

#### `.github/dependabot.yml` - Enhanced Dependabot Configuration
- Added comprehensive dependency update automation
- Configured grouping of patch and security updates
- Added support for Python, GitHub Actions, Docker, and npm ecosystems
- Implemented ignore rules for hardware-specific packages
- Added proper labeling and reviewer assignment

#### `.github/workflows/dependency-management.yml` - NEW: Dependency Management Workflow
- Automated weekly dependency audits
- Security vulnerability scanning integration
- License compliance checking
- Automated issue creation for audit reports
- Artifact upload for audit reports and analysis

### 4. Documentation

#### `docs/dependency-management.md` - Enhanced Strategy Document
- Comprehensive dependency management strategy
- Detailed installation options and use cases
- Clear pinning strategy for different types of dependencies
- Vulnerability management and response procedures
- Dependency reduction and optimization guidelines
- Emergency procedures and rollback strategies
- Best practices for development and production

#### `README.md` - Added Dependency Management Section
- Added new section explaining installation options
- Documented minimal vs full installation approaches
- Explained optional dependency categories
- Provided clear examples of feature-specific installations

### 5. Tools and Scripts

#### `scripts/dependency_audit.py` - NEW: Dependency Audit Tool
- Comprehensive dependency analysis and audit tool
- Features include:
  - Outdated package detection
  - Security vulnerability scanning
  - Dependency size analysis
  - License compliance checking
  - Dependency tree generation
- JSON output format for automation
- Command-line interface with multiple options

## Key Improvements

### 1. Dependency Reduction
- **Before**: ~58 packages in monolithic requirements.txt
- **After**: ~20 core packages + optional groups
- **Reduction**: 65% reduction in minimal installation size

### 2. Security Enhancements
- Added automated security vulnerability scanning
- Implemented weekly security update automation
- Added license compliance checking
- Enhanced security response procedures

### 3. Automation
- **Dependabot**: Automated dependency updates with intelligent grouping
- **GitHub Actions**: Weekly dependency audits and security scans
- **Make targets**: Simple commands for common dependency tasks
- **Audit script**: Comprehensive dependency analysis tool

### 4. Documentation
- Clear dependency management strategy
- Installation options for different use cases
- Maintenance procedures and best practices
- Emergency response procedures

### 5. Developer Experience
- Exact version pinning for development dependencies
- Clear separation of core vs optional dependencies
- Easy-to-use make targets for common tasks
- Comprehensive audit tooling

## Installation Options Summary

### Minimal Installation (Production)
```bash
pip install -r requirements-core.txt
```
- ~20 packages
- Core functionality only
- Ideal for production deployments

### Feature-Specific Installation
```bash
pip install piwardrive[analysis,visualization]
```
- Install only needed features
- Reduces bloat and security surface
- Flexible deployment options

### Full Installation (Development)
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```
- All features and development tools
- Complete development environment
- ~70-80 total packages

## Maintenance Workflow

### Automated (Weekly)
- Dependabot creates PRs for security updates
- GitHub Actions runs dependency audits
- Security scans check for vulnerabilities
- License compliance is verified

### Manual (Monthly)
- Review dependency audit reports
- Update major versions as needed
- Clean up unused dependencies
- Review and update documentation

### Emergency (As Needed)
- Critical security vulnerabilities
- Hardware compatibility issues
- Breaking changes in dependencies
- Rollback procedures if needed

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Reduced Bloat**: 65% reduction in minimal installation size
2. **Enhanced Security**: Automated vulnerability scanning and updates
3. **Better Organization**: Clear dependency categories and documentation
