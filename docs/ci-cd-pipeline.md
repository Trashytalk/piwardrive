MONITORING_API_KEY=your-monitoring-api-key

# Notifications
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR/SLACK/WEBHOOK
EMAIL_SMTP_SERVER=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_SMTP_PORT=587
EMAIL_USERNAME=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-app-password

# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost/piwardrive
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379

# Performance Testing
PERFORMANCE_THRESHOLD=10  # 10% degradation threshold
CONCURRENT_USERS=50

```

### GitHub Secrets

Configure these secrets in your GitHub repository:

- `MONITORING_URL`: URL for your monitoring system
- `MONITORING_API_KEY`: API key for monitoring system
- `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`: Slack webhook for notifications
- `STAGING_AUTH_TOKEN`: Authentication token for staging environment
- `PRODUCTION_DEPLOY_KEY`: SSH key for production deployment

### Performance Configuration

The `performance_config.json` file contains:

```json
{
  "monitoring_interval": 60,
  "performance_thresholds": {
    "api_response_time": 2.0,
    "database_query_time": 0.1,
    "memory_usage_percent": 80.0,
    "cpu_usage_percent": 80.0,
    "disk_usage_percent": 85.0
  },
  "load_test_config": {
    "default_concurrent_users": 10,
    "default_duration_seconds": 60,
    "stress_test_max_users": 200
  }

- Memory usage > 80%
- CPU usage > 80%
- Test coverage < 80%
- Performance regression > 10%
- Deployment failure

### Notification Channels

- Slack notifications for immediate alerts
- Email summaries for daily/weekly reports
- Dashboard integration for real-time monitoring

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Performance Tests Failing**:
   - Check if the application is properly started
   - Verify database connectivity
   - Check system resources

2. **Deployment Failures**:
   - Verify health check endpoints
   - Check Docker image availability
   - Validate environment variables

3. **Coverage Issues**:
   - Ensure all test files are included
   - Check for missing test cases
   - Verify coverage configuration

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check application health
curl -f http://localhost:8080/health

# Verify database connection
python -c "from src.database import test_connection; test_connection()"

# Check Docker containers
docker ps -a

# View performance metrics
python scripts/performance_monitor.py --debug
```

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Monitoring**: Review performance metrics weekly
2. **Threshold Updates**: Adjust thresholds based on baseline improvements
3. **Security Updates**: Apply security patches promptly
4. **Test Coverage**: Maintain >90% test coverage
5. **Documentation**: Keep deployment procedures updated
6. **Rollback Testing**: Regularly test rollback procedures
