## Diagram Standards

All diagrams follow consistent standards:

### Mermaid Syntax
- All diagrams use Mermaid syntax for consistency and maintainability
- Diagrams are embedded directly in markdown files
- For RST files, diagrams use the `.. mermaid::` directive

### Color Coding
- **Light Blue (#e1f5fe)**: Primary/main components
- **Light Green (#e8f5e8)**: Core services/successful states
- **Light Orange (#fff3e0)**: Secondary components/processes
- **Light Pink (#fce4ec)**: Optional/tertiary components
- **Light Purple (#f3e5f5)**: Configuration/settings
- **Light Red (#ffebee)**: Error states/critical components
- **Light Teal (#e0f2f1)**: External services/connections

### Diagram Types
- **Architecture Diagrams**: Show system component relationships
- **Flow Diagrams**: Show process flows and decision trees
- **Sequence Diagrams**: Show interactions over time
- **Network Diagrams**: Show connections and data flow

## Benefits

These diagrams provide:

1. **Visual Learning**: Complex concepts explained through visual representation
2. **Quick Reference**: At-a-glance understanding of system architecture
3. **Onboarding**: New developers can quickly understand system structure
4. **Documentation Quality**: Professional, comprehensive documentation
5. **Maintenance**: Clear visual aids for system maintenance and troubleshooting

## Maintenance

- Diagrams should be updated when system architecture changes
- New features should include corresponding diagram updates
- Mermaid syntax ensures diagrams render consistently across platforms
- Regular review of diagram accuracy during documentation updates

## Future Enhancements

Potential future diagram additions:
- Network topology diagrams for multi-node deployments
- Database schema diagrams for complex data relationships
- Integration diagrams for third-party services
- Performance benchmarking visualizations
- Security threat model diagrams
